# RealCRM

An AI-powered personal networking CRM that helps you maintain professional relationships.

**Upload your contacts, connect your accounts. RealCRM tells you who to reach out to and writes the message.**

## What is RealCRM?

RealCRM is a single-player networking tool designed for professionals who want to stay on top of their relationships without the overhead of a full-blown CRM. It connects to your existing communication channels (Gmail, Telegram, Twitter/X), analyzes your interaction patterns, and uses AI to suggest who you should reach out to and draft contextual messages.

## Key Capabilities

- **Contact Management** -- import from CSV, Google Contacts, or add manually. Full-text search across names, emails, bios, and message content.
- **Multi-Platform Sync** -- Gmail threads, Telegram DMs, Twitter DMs and mentions, and LinkedIn messages are automatically imported as interactions.
- **AI Follow-Up Suggestions** -- Claude analyzes your interaction patterns and generates contextual draft messages when it's time to reconnect.
- **Identity Resolution** -- automatically detects when contacts across different platforms (Gmail, Telegram, Twitter, LinkedIn) are the same person and merges them.
- **Organization Tracking** -- group contacts by company, track relationship health per org.
- **LinkedIn Extension** -- Chrome extension syncs LinkedIn messages and profiles via the Voyager API, with AI suggestion buttons injected into the LinkedIn composer.
- **Bio Monitoring** -- detects Twitter and Telegram bio changes (job changes, milestones) and surfaces them as events.
- **Relationship Scoring** -- automatic scoring based on interaction recency, frequency, and reciprocity.
