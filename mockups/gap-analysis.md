# Mockup vs Current Implementation: Gap Analysis

## Context
Reviewing 4 new HTML mockups (dashboard-v2, contacts-v2, contact-detail, settings-redesign) against the existing frontend (17 pages, 15+ components, 20+ hooks) to identify features wired in current code that are missing or dropped in the new mockup designs.

---

## 1. Entire Pages Missing from Mockups

These 4 pages exist in code with full functionality but have **no mockup at all**:

| Page | Route | What It Does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Suggestions Digest** | `/suggestions` | Full-page suggestion management: generate, send, snooze, dismiss, regenerate, channel switching. Dashboard mockup only shows 3 inline cards. |
| **Archive** | `/contacts/archive` | Dedicated archived contacts list with search, unarchive action, pagination. |
| **Identity Resolution** | `/identity` | Full duplicate pair list, scan trigger, match score display, merge/reject workflow. |
| **Notifications** | `/notifications` | Notification center: list with expand/collapse details, mark-read, mark-all-read, type icons, related page links. |

**Impact:** These pages need mockups if they should follow the new design language, or a decision to remove/merge them.

## 2. Navigation & Layout Differences

| Feature | Current Code | Mockup |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Sidebar nav** | Vertical left sidebar with static links | Top horizontal navbar |
| **Contacts dropdown** | Archive + Resolve Duplicates nested under Contacts | Same (matches) |
| **User menu dropdown** | Shows user name, has sign-out action | Shows "Alex" with chevron but **no dropdown content** |
| **Global search (Cmd+K)** | Not implemented | Mockup shows `Cmd+K` search button in navbar (new feature) |
| **Onboarding wizard** | 4-step onboarding at `/onboarding` | No mockup (dashboard has empty state instead) |

---

## 3. Dashboard: Features in Code but Missing from Mockup

| Feature | Current Code | Mockup Has? |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **"Quick actions" panel** | Buttons for "Identity Resolution" and "Suggestions Digest" | No - replaced by Needs Attention widget |
| **"Recently contacted" card** | Shows 5 recent contacts with scores and last interaction time | No - replaced by "New & Active" widget |
| **"Relationship health" as stacked bar** | Single stacked horizontal bar (Strong/Warm/Cold) | Mockup uses separate progress bars per tier |
| **4 stat cards** | Total Contacts, Pending Follow-ups, Strong Relationships (3 cards) | Total Contacts, Active Relationships, Interactions This Week, Pending Suggestions (4 cards with trend badges) |

**Stat card differences:** Code has 3 stats; mockup has 4 with `+24` / `-12%` trend indicators (not in code).

## 8. Summary: Features Wired in Code but Dropped/Missing in Mockups

### Entire pages needing mockups:
1. Suggestions page
2. Archive page
3. Identity Resolution page
4. Notifications page
5. Organizations page
6. Onboarding wizard

### Coded features with no mockup equivalent:
1. Quick actions panel (dashboard)
2. Recently contacted card (dashboard)
3. Source filter options beyond 3 platforms
4. Has interactions / interaction days / birthday filters
5. Full-page Add Contact form (vs modal)
6. Activity breakdown pie chart (contact detail)
7. Telegram common groups display
8. Google Calendar sync UI
9. SyncButtonWrapper with shimmer progress
10. Success modal for OAuth connections
11. Full tag taxonomy discover/apply workflow

### Key design decisions needed:
1. **Sidebar nav → Top navbar**: Major layout change, needs migration plan
2. **Cmd+K global search**: New feature in mockups, needs implementation
3. **Per-row kebab menus**: Mockup has them, code doesn't
4. **Chat-like timeline vs flat list**: Different interaction display paradigm
5. **5-tab settings vs flat page**: Significant restructuring
6. **Toast system vs inline messages**: Different notification approach
7. **SVG score ring vs text badge**: Visual upgrade for contact detail
